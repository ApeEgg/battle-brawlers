<strong>Battle Brawlers</strong> is a strategy auto-battler playable in your browser.
<br /><br />
Your main objective is to upgrade your <i>Ludus</i> by obtaining experience and leveling it up.
<br /><br />
You can recruit Brawlers to fight for you. Each Brawler can be equipped with unique items and abilities.
<br /><br />
Every 5 Ludus levels, you unlock an additional Brawler slot.
<br /><br /><br />

<Headline text="Combat" small />
Combat is automatic once you start a fight.
<br /><br />
<strong>Battle Brawlers</strong> uses a <i>tick system</i>. A tick cycle is normally
<strong>12 ticks</strong>, but it can expand up to <strong>15 ticks</strong>. Each ability you place
in your <strong>Active Abilities</strong> has its own tick length, which represents how long the
ability takes to cast or remain active.
<br /><br />
Tick cycles repeat until a winner is determined.
<br /><br /><br />
<Headline text="The arena" small />
There’s a vast roster of fights available in the arena. Each fight features its own unique set of enemies
and rewards.
<br /><br />
Boss fights unlock additional content in <strong>Battle Brawlers</strong>. But be wary! Luck-based
combat stats are disabled during boss fights!
